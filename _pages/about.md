I pride myself in being a resourceful Engineer and visionary, experienced in working at electronics and semiconductor manufacturing industry. I love to work with the newest technologies. Engineering and automation are my passion!

I'm always looking to be challenged, and to challenge others. Driving other engineers and scientists to think outside of the box, and really bring out their creative abilities is what motivates me. Let's connect and see what we can bring together!

Over the past one year, I have worked at my alma mater and after few months at a Japanese company. I have learnt a lot about the Japanese language and culture. I have also received professional hands-on training on IC layout, physical design and front-end verification from a leading semiconductor industry of Bangladesh.

My areas of expertise include:
Internet of things(IoT), VLSI Design, artificial intelligence(AI), computer architecture, data Science, 5G communications, team building and leadership.
