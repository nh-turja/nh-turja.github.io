<h2>Peripheral Venous Pressure Signal</h2>
<p>This project has been my main focus of PhD research. We are trying to correlate the fluid status of a patient with Peripheral Venous Pressure (PVP) signal. Some elementary results have shown promising results that PVP signal is able to distinguish between dehydrated and hydrated patients. We have also developed an unsupervised algorithm based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter">Kalman filter</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model">hidden Markov model (HMM)</a> that can detect anomalous segments of PVP signal recording. <br /></p>

<h2>IoT Based Railway Fishplate and Track Monitoring System for Safe Transport</h2>
<p>This project has been my main focus of my work as a research assistant.
In 2019, I along with <a href="https://mfarhadhossain.buet.ac.bd/"> Professor Dr. Md Farhad Hossain</a> , Department of EEE, BUET
gave a research proposal to <a href="http://www.ugc.gov.bd"> University Grants Commission (UGC)</a> to research and develop a state-of-the-art system to
solve a major issue in railway system of Bangladesh using Internet of Things (IoT) technology.
We received a grant of 3,00,000 Taka (3534$) from UGC for the year of 2020.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The primary objective of this project was to design an online system to detect and locate any unstable/removed fishplate and uprooted rail tracks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This IoT based system can monitor every fishplate of the track in real-time server and is highly accurate to detect and localize any displaced fishplate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In case of any unwanted event occurs, a signal/message will be sent to the central monitoring system and associated fishplates and tracks will be displayed in a digital map.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Rice Panicle Segmentation</h2>
<p>We have developed a Gaussian mixture model based unsupervised image segmentation algorithm that can segment rice panicles. The proposed method outperforms existing methods like <a href="https://plantmethods.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13007-017-0254-7">Panicle-SEG</a> with an average F1 score greater than 80%. </p>

<h2>Deep Learning with Optical Coherence Tomography </h2>
<p>I worked at <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/">Nokia Bell Labs</a> on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) image segmentation problem during summer of 2019. I applied deep learning techniques to solve the problem. </p>
<h2>Practical Wireless Communication Problems</h2>
<p>After finishing my undergraduate studies I started working as a System Engineer at Grameenphone, part of the Norwegian Telenor Group, is the largest telecommunications operator in Bangladesh. I solved some interesting problems related to radio access and microwave backhaul there. A simple example is illustrated here.</p>

<p>A particular cell of a BTS was suffering for low MPD and as a reason we found that the cell was overshooting at long distances. Which can be understood from measurement reports (MR) of TA = 21 to  31. The cell was using Kathrein 739636 antenna. This antenna has 6 degree fixed electrical downtilt. The planned mechanical uptilt was -3 degree. After changing the mechanical tilting from -3 degree to 0 degree the number MRs of TA between 21 to 31 reduced significantly yielding regular MPD. The red line indicates the moment we changed the mechanical tilting. </p>
<h2>Adaptive Beamforming with Microphone Array</h2>
<p>We as a team participated in the Cadence Xtensa Design Contest 2015. Our team was runner-up among total 16 submissions. The objective of the project was to implement an adaptive beamforming algorithm for a microphone array on an Xtensa processor. All the confirmed submissions were provided with Xtensa Software Developers Toolkit to work on.</p>

<h2>Stochastic Modeling of Wireless Network</h2>
<p>We used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process">Poisson point process (PPP)</a> and Hard-core poisson process (HCPP) to simulate BTS locations and evaluated various network parameters like throughput, SINR, outage probability using Monte Carlo simulation incorporating the idea of resource blocks. We used <a href="http://www5.tu-ilmenau.de/nt/generic/paper_pdfs/D1.1.2.pdf">WINNER II channel model</a> for path loss.</p>
