<h2>Peripheral Venous Pressure Signal</h2>
<p>This project has been my main focus of PhD research. We are trying to correlate the fluid status of a patient with Peripheral Venous Pressure (PVP) signal. Some elementary results have shown promising results that PVP signal is able to distinguish between dehydrated and hydrated patients. We have also developed an unsupervised algorithm based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter">Kalman filter</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model">hidden Markov model (HMM)</a> that can detect anomalous segments of PVP signal recording. <br /></p>

<h2>IoT Based Railway Fishplate and Track Monitoring System for Safe Transport [On Going]</h2>
<p>This project is my main focus of my working as a research assistant at BUET.
In 2019, I along with <a href="https://mfarhadhossain.buet.ac.bd/"> Professor Dr. Md Farhad Hossain</a>, Department of EEE, BUET
gave a research proposal to <a href="http://www.ugc.gov.bd"> University Grants Commission (UGC)</a> to perform a research and develop a state-of-the-art system to
solve a major issue in the railway track system of Bangladesh using Internet of Things (IoT) technology.
We have received a grant of 3,00,000 Taka (eq. 3534 Dollars) from UGC for the year of 2020.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The primary objective of this project is to design an online system to detect and locate any unstable/removed fishplate and uprooted rail tracks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This IoT based system can monitor every fishplate of the track in real-time server and is highly accurate to detect and localize any displaced fishplate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In case of any unwanted event occurs, a signal/message will be sent to the central monitoring system and associated fishplates and tracks will be displayed in a digital map.</p>
</ul>

<h2>IoT Based Wristband and Contact Tracing App for the Protection from COVID-19 [On Going]</h2>
<p> After the COVID-19 outbreak happened, our "Team Hawkbit" along with <a href="https://mfarhadhossain.buet.ac.bd/"> Professor Dr. Md Farhad Hossain</a>, Department of EEE, BUET
had decided to build a QR code based app to restrict the movement of corona affected patient. We are currently working on this project.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A restriction strategy using a contact tracing mobile app data that is interactive via Bluetooth when installed between two phones.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Location data and contact IDs are stored at a secured database in the cloud service to find the travel history of the patient at a later period if needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>QR codes which are red, green and yellow are generated for the people to restrict the patient/possible patient away from the healthy people.</p>
</ul>

<h2>A Cyber-secured MQTT Based Offline Automation System</h2>
<p> It was a collaborative project between ACI Logistics Limited and Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).
The objective of this project was to build a desktop software which can monitor and control a supershop's electrical compliances using Internet of Things (IoT).
Our "Team Hawkbit" along with <a href="https://mfarhadhossain.buet.ac.bd/"> Professor Dr. Md Farhad Hossain</a>, Department of EEE, BUET

<h2>Rice Panicle Segmentation</h2>
<p>We have developed a Gaussian mixture model based unsupervised image segmentation algorithm that can segment rice panicles. The proposed method outperforms existing methods like <a href="https://plantmethods.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13007-017-0254-7">Panicle-SEG</a> with an average F1 score greater than 80%. </p>

<h2>Practical Wireless Communication Problems</h2>
<p>After finishing my undergraduate studies I started working as a System Engineer at Grameenphone, part of the Norwegian Telenor Group, is the largest telecommunications operator in Bangladesh. I solved some interesting problems related to radio access and microwave backhaul there. A simple example is illustrated here.</p>

<p>A particular cell of a BTS was suffering for low MPD and as a reason we found that the cell was overshooting at long distances. Which can be understood from measurement reports (MR) of TA = 21 to  31. The cell was using Kathrein 739636 antenna. This antenna has 6 degree fixed electrical downtilt. The planned mechanical uptilt was -3 degree. After changing the mechanical tilting from -3 degree to 0 degree the number MRs of TA between 21 to 31 reduced significantly yielding regular MPD. The red line indicates the moment we changed the mechanical tilting. </p>

<h2>Stochastic Modeling of Wireless Network</h2>
<p>We used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process">Poisson point process (PPP)</a> and Hard-core poisson process (HCPP) to simulate BTS locations and evaluated various network parameters like throughput, SINR, outage probability using Monte Carlo simulation incorporating the idea of resource blocks. We used <a href="http://www5.tu-ilmenau.de/nt/generic/paper_pdfs/D1.1.2.pdf">WINNER II channel model</a> for path loss.</p>
